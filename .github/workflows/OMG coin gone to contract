Hello. I did OMG coin L1 and L2 on boba network, but the address went to contract address from where I unable to pull up my 1437 OMG coin.

Please help me out in bringing back my OMG coin to metamask address.

Metamask address is 0x310AcB97458c0D420547C41360Ef975EB6295616

OMG coin went to contract address 0x1a26ef6575b7bbb864d984d9255c069f6c361a14

From contract address it went to 0x63064da709aa39f0278c229d04d9394cfa8ce50e.

So how could I get back my coin.
